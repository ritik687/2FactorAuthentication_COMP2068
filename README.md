# Two Factor Authentication 

First, start with the basic code that is in the directory basicCode at the link: https://github.com/ritik687/2FactorAuthentication_COMP2068.git. 
Final application that is completely set-up is the demoFinalCode directory in the same link. In the demoFinalCode, 2FA is implemented that is basically time based OTP(one time password) using google authenticator app with qr codes.

## basicCode: 
A base Express project with handlebars templating and a simple login feature is provided by the cloned basicCode.
The first element of authentication is set up via a simple login. You can view the complete video to setup basic code at this link()
